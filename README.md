This is a set of scripts I use to setup a variety of security tools on
[Kali Linux](https://kali.org).  The defaults may not be for everyone, but it
works for me and is shared in the hopes it might be useful for others.

You're welcome to send a pull request if you've done something awesome, but
mostly you'll want to fork this to customize your own tool lists.
